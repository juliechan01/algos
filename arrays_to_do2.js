// REVERSE
// Given a numerical array, reverse the order of values, in-place. The reversed array should have the same length, with existing elements moved to other indices so that order of elements is reversed. Working 'in-place' means that you cannot use a second array – move values within the array that you are given. As always, do not use built-in array functions such as splice().
function reverse(array) {
    return null;
}

const originalArray = [];


// ROTATE

// FILTER RANGE
// Alan is good at breaking secret codes. One method is to eliminate values that lie outside of a specific known range. Given arr and values min and max, retain only the array values between min and max. Work in-place: return the array you are given, with values in original order. No built-in array functions.



// CONCAT
